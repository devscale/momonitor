# MoMonitor

MoMonitor was originally developed as a replacement to Nagios. It is currently the primary monitoring / reporting tool used at [MoPub](http://mopub.com), which monitors hundreds of servers and billions of requests everyday. MoMonitor was created by Rob McQueen [@systemizer](https://twitter.com/systemizer) and is maintained by MoPub.

For directions on getting started and how MoMonitor works, please see [http://mopub.github.com/momonitor](http://mopub.github.com/momonitor)
